The latest source code for this project is maintained on [GitHub][2].

You can download all the project source files in [ZIP][3] or [TAR][4] format:  

* Unpack the archive and rename the resulting folder to "evlib".
* Move it to the "libraries" folder in your Arduino sketches area.
* Restart the Arduino IDE to make sure it sees the new files.

There are a few useful examples in the "examples" folder.
